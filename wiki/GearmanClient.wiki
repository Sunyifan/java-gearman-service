#summary GearmanClient Summary

= Introduction =

The GearmanClient is the client class for the Gearman distributed job system, providing a framework for sending jobs to one or more Gearman job servers. These jobs are then distributed out to a farm of workers.

= Job Servers Communication =

The "addServer" method is used to specify what gearman job servers to communicate with. There are two types server communication, local and remote.

== Local Communication ==

To communicate with a job server in the local address space, we call "addServer" with the GearmanServer object as the argument. This allows the client framework to pass packets directly to the local job server.

{{{
/**
 * Specifies that the client may communicate with the server locally.<br>
 * 
 * @param srvr
 *    The local job server to communicate with
 * @return
 *    <code>true</code> if and only if the server was added to the list of
 *    servers
 */
boolean addServer(GearmanServer srvr);
}}}

== Remote Communication ==

To communicate with a job server over the network, we call "addServer" with a InetSocketAddress object representing the server's location.

{{{
/**
 * Specifies that the client may communicate with the server locally.<br>
 * The server's location is added to a list. A connection is not made until
 * it's nessary.<br>
 *
 * @param adrs
 *    The address of the remote job server
 * @return
 *    <code>true</code> if and only if the address was added to the list of
 *    servers
 */
boolean addServer(InetSocketAddress adrs)
