#summary GearmanClient Summary

= Introduction =

The GearmanClient is the client class for the Gearman distributed job system, providing a framework for sending jobs to one or more Gearman job servers. These jobs are then distributed out to a farm of workers.

= Job Servers Communication =

The "addServer" method is used to specify what gearman job servers to communicate with. There are two types server communication, local and remote.

== Local Communication ==

To submit jobs to servers running in the local address space, we use the following method.

{{{
boolean addServer(GearmanServer srvr)
}}}

This method adds a local GearmanServer instance to the list of job servers the client may submit jobs to. Packets are passed directly to jobs servers specified  with this method, lowering latency.

_Paramiters_
  * srvr: The job server running in the local address space

_Return Value_
  * true if and only if the local server was added to the list of job servers to submit jobs to

_Usage Example_
{{{
private final GearmanClient client = ...

public void addLocalServer(GearmanServer server) {
   // Add the client to communicate with the local server
   client.addServer(server);
}
}}}
== Remote Communication ==
{{{
boolean addServer(InetSocketAddress adrs)
}}}

To communicate with a job server over the network, we call "addServer" with a InetSocketAddress object representing the server's location.

== Get Server Count ==
{{{
int getServerCount()
}}}

To get the total number of servers, we use the "getServerCount" method.
