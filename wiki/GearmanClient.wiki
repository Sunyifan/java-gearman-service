#summary GearmanClient Summary

= Introduction =

The GearmanClient is the client class for the Gearman distributed job system, providing a framework for sending jobs to one or more Gearman job servers. These jobs are then distributed out to a farm of workers.

= Job Servers Communication =

The "addServer" method is used to specify what gearman job servers to communicate with. There are two types server communication, local and remote.

== Local Communication ==

To communicate with a job server in the local address space, we call "addServer" with the GearmanServer object as the argument. This allows the client framework to pass packets directly to the local job server.

{{{
/**
 * Adds a local server to the list of servers the client may submit jobs to.<br>
 * 
 * @param srvr
 *    The local job server
 * @return
 *    <code>true</code> if and only if the server was added to the list of
 *    servers
 */
boolean addServer(GearmanServer srvr);
}}}

== Remote Communication ==

To communicate with a job server over the network, we call "addServer" with a InetSocketAddress object representing the server's location.

{{{
/**
 * Adds the location of a remote job server to the list of servers the client
 * may submit jobs to<br>
 *
 * @param adrs
 *    The address of the remote job server
 * @return
 *    <code>true</code> if and only if the address was added to the list of
 *    servers
 */
boolean addServer(InetSocketAddress adrs)
