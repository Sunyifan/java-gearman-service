#summary GearmanClient Summary

= Introduction =

The GearmanClient is the client class for the Gearman distributed job system, providing a framework for sending jobs to one or more Gearman job servers. These jobs are then distributed out to a farm of workers.

= Job Servers Communication =

When a job is submitted with a GearmanClient, it's immediately sent to a known job server. The "addServer" method is used to specify what job servers the client can submit jobs to.

== Local Communication ==

To communicate with a job server in the local address space, we call "addServer" with the GearmanServer object as the argument. This will allow the framework to pass packets directly to the server, without network communication.

== Network Communication ==
