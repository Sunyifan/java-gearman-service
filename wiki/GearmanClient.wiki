#summary GearmanClient Summary

= Introduction =

The GearmanClient is the client class for the Gearman distributed job system, providing a framework for sending jobs to one or more Gearman job servers. These jobs are then distributed out to a farm of workers.

= Job Servers Communication =

The "addServer" method is used to specify what gearman job servers to communicate with. There are two types server communication, local and remote.

== Local Communication ==

To communicate with a job server in the local address space, we call "addServer" with the GearmanServer object as the argument. This allows the client framework to pass packets directly to the local job server.

{{{
boolean addServer(GearmanServer srvr)
}}}

== Remote Communication ==

To communicate with a job server over the network, we call "addServer" with a InetSocketAddress object representing the server's location.

{{{
boolean addServer(InetSocketAddress adrs)
}}}

== Server Count ==

To get the total number of servers, we use the "getServerCount" method.

== {{{ int getServerCount }}} ==
