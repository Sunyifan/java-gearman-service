#summary GearmanClient Summary

= Introduction =

The GearmanClient is the client class for the Gearman distributed job system, providing a framework for sending jobs to one or more Gearman job servers. These jobs are then distributed out to a farm of workers.

= Adding Job Servers =

When a job is submitted with a GearmanClient, it's immediately sent to a known job server. The "addServer" method is used to specify what job servers the client can submit jobs to.
